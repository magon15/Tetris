I would be glad to see you enjoy the first game I've ever created on Java, Tetris! I'm still working to make my code readable, but I'm still a newbie and I've got many things to learn. If you want to make changes to this code then you're very welcome! Also if you could give constructive feedback, I want to know. I'm very open to new ideas that could make this game better. Thank you! :)
